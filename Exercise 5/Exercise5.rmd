# Exercise 5


From the output we can conclude that the model accurately describes the Wage using the variables Education and Gender.
As the R^2 is 0.99 (almost 1) we can conclude that with our dataset we explain the bulk part of the variance.
Additionally, we can conclude that for our dataset both gender and education have a very high significance due to the low P value.

## Task 2
Read Data, remove model and ERP (model is not usable as it is unique, thus can be seen as an ID)
```{r}
computers <- read.table("/home/tobias/unibe/statistical methods in R/Exercise 5/Computers.txt", header = T, as.is = FALSE)
