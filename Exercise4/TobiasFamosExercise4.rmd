# Exercise 4
## Task 1
Load the data
```{r}
education <- read.table("EducationBis.txt", header=T)
```
position the caret at any line or the code chunk, then click "+".

The code chunk appears:
```{r}
```

Type any R code in the chunk, for example:
```{r}
mycars <- within(mtcars, { cyl <- ordered(cyl) })
mycars
```

Now, click the **Run** button on the chunk toolbar to [execute](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/r-markdown.html#run-r-code) the chunk code. The result should be placed under the chunk.
Click the **Knit and Open Document** to build and preview an output.
